Hi ${order.recipient_name}, Important Notice:Your Amazon Order:(${order.order_id})
<--subject seperator-->
Dear ${order.recipient_name},

Hope you are doing well.

We are contacting you regarding the delivery status of your Amazon order. I know this is very disappointing but I have to let you know about the difficulty you are facing.

I'm sorry that we are unable to ship your order via Expedited Shipping this time, as currently we can only offer Standard Shipping, which usually takes 3-6 weeks to arrive.

If standard shipping is acceptable to you, please let me know as soon as possible so that we will ship it immediately and issue a partial shipping refund to your account. It will take 3-7 business days for the refund to clear in your account.

If not, could you please log in to Amazon account, go to 'Your Orders' and click 'Request Cancellation' button? In this way you can get your money back as soon as possible so that you can get the item from someone else.

I sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience this matter has caused to you. Please accept my apologies and thanks for your understanding.

Best Regards,
Customer Service Team
