Hello ${order.recipient_name}, Looking forward your response:(${order.order_id})
<--subject seperator-->
Dear ${order.recipient_name},

We are contacting you regarding order delivery status. I know this is very disappointing but I have to let you know about the difficulty you are facing.

As we prepared the shipment just now, we found the last item was just taken by another customer who placed her order just one moment earlier than yours. I checked the inventory and found we only have paperback copies now. Before contacting you we also reached out to our supplier today but they said the paperback copies are coming in at least 3 months.

If you would like to receive a hardcover copy, please let me know asap so that we will ship it immediately.

If you would not like to wait for the new stock to come in, please reply this email and we will issue a full refund to your account.  

I guess you might have received a shipment confirmation letter. This was caused by the miscommunication between our customer service and warehouse staff. The customer service staff confirmed the shipment in the IT system just moments before the warehouse staff notified them not to do so because the last copy was found to be hardcover. 

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused to you. Please accept my apologies and let me know your thoughts.
