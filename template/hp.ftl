Hello ${order.recipient_name}, Looking forward your response:(${order.order_id})

Dear ${order.recipient_name},

Hope you are doing well.

We are contacting you regarding the delivery status of your Amazon order. I know this is very disappointing but I have to let you know about the difficulty you are facing.

As we prepared the shipment just now, we found that we don't have the item you ordered in our warehouse. I checked the inventory and noticed that we only have paperback copies now. Before contacting you we also reached out to our suppliers today but they said the hardcover copies are coming in at least 3 months.

If you would like to receive a paperback copy, please let me know as soon as possible so that we will ship it immediately.

If you don't want the paperback copy or to wait for the new stock to come in, please reply to this email and we will issue a full refund to your account.

I guess you might have received a shipment confirmation letter. This was caused by the miscommunication between our customer service and warehouse staff. The customer service staff had confirmed the shipment in the IT system just before the warehouse staff notified them not to do so because the hardcover copy was not available.

I sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience this matter has caused to you. Please accept my apologies and thanks for your understanding.

Best Regards,
Customer Service Team
