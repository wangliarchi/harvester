Hello ${order.recipient_name}, Looking forward your response:(${order.order_id})
<--subject seperator-->
Dear ${order.recipient_name},

We are contacting you regarding order delivery status. I know this is very disappointing but I have to let you know about the difficulty you are facing.

As we prepared the shipment just now, we found the last item was just taken by another customer who placed her order just one moment earlier than yours. I checked the inventory and found we only have paperback copies now. Before contacting you we also reached out to our supplier today but they said the hardcover copies are coming in at least 3 months.

If you would like to receive a paperback copy, please let me know asap so that we will ship it immediately.

If you would not like to wait for the new stock to come in, can you please log in Amazon, go to 'Your Orders' and click 'Request Cancellation' button? In this way you can get your money back asap so than you can get the book from someone else.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this has caused to you. I understand the book is in your urgent need. Please accept my apologies and let me know your thoughts.
