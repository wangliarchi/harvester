Hope you are doing well.
       
We are contacting you regarding the delivery status of your Amazon order. I know this is very disappointing but I have to let you know about the difficulty you are facing.

I'm sorry that we are unable to ship your product within the Amazon estimated delivery time frame since the product is not available in the nearest fulfillment center.

We do have this product in our foreign fulfillment center. If you would like to get it, we can deliver the item to you in 20 to 45 business days and issue you partial shipping refund.

If the above option is unacceptable to you, could you please log in to Amazon account, go to 'Your Orders' and click 'Request Cancellation' button? In this way you can get your money back as soon as possible so that you can get the item from someone else.

I sincerely apologize for all the inconvenience this matter has caused to you. Please accept my apologies and thanks for your understanding.
